    STOCK IS A VOLATILE ASSET CLASS. WHEN BANKRUPTCIES AND INTERVENTION AND HEADLINE NEWS ARE ALL FINANCIALS AND JOBS
    ARE LOST, then it's time for the JNK and TQQQ.
    <br /><br />
    BEARISH CASE:
    <br />
    “The geopolitical backdrop, the China slowdown story, the potential for energy rationing in Europe, the inflation,
    the feds hiking, the strong dollar, and housing markets point to clear recession risks,” said ING analysts in a note
    on Thursday.
    Now bonds has such a yield, that TINA effect is waning.  It's now TARA (THERE ARE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES)
    <br />
    <br /><br />
    THE BULL CASE:
    <br />
    valuation getting cheaper by price correction, by inflation of wages, by riskiest assets all thrashed. If
    corporations owns america and they are getting cheaper, selling them now is not the right move. Retail traders are very bearish now.
    <br />
    UUP is now in overbought. TLT in oversold. VIX in overbought. the end game is near.
    <br />
    <br /><br />
    MAIN STRATEGY
    <b>
      <br />
      - know the size of move and time of day:  huge move before 8:30?  dont fade it until into 9am and still make new high/low.  huge gap down?  know that the bounce could be huge too. know the expected value of move based on what the overnight has shown you.
      <br />
      - better off with small consistent moves
      <br />
      - think long early on. and short after 9am
      <br />
      - only trade at open IF going LONG when huge gap down and daily oversold.
      <br />
      - if going long at SPY VWAP bounce, choose from "ETFs" with least retrace.
      <br />
      - if going long at SPY LOD pivot, choose from "big retrace on big red market" still above VWAP.
      <br />
      - if going short at SPY HOD pivot, choose from "in downtrend for short" with least retrace.
      <br />
      - if going short at SPY VWAP reject, choose from "inverse ETFs" still green and leading the watchlist.

    ON 9/15/2022 think BEARISH
    <br />
    you dont get days after days of red, 4th day probably get some green, so even in downtrend, you can play long but
    you have to wait for the double pivot. dont get stuck going short near the bottom!

    <br />
    UPCOMING EVENTS: FOMC is coming next week.
    <br />
    seasonality: sept and oct are generally bad so we can expect no buyers.
    <br />
    best case right now is we get stuck and we need to play PIVOTS intraday.

    <br /><br />
    ON 9/13/2022 think BEARISH
    <br />

    <br />
    SPY is in a small timeframe wedge.
    <br />
    SPY Heiken Ashi has turned GREEN
    <br />
    end of Sept like to be bearish
